Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The goal of my app was to create a database app and include user level permissions and logins, however, i had a great deal of trouble getting this to to build and halfway through our term my hard drive failed. So starting from scratch i ran into new issue. this is the level of work I was able to get finished.
Issues aside, my app was desgined to keep track of high volume of items within a narow item list. 5 to ten total items but with a high volume. If your company deals in only a few items but in large quantity my inventory app would help keep track of those items.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
we needed a login screen, a user managment screen, an inventory screen and an add or remove item screen. the idea behind my original UI desing was simple and desinged to keep things stright forward for the less tech savy users. Large buttons and clear text in Calibri font which reads nicely on the mobile screen. This layout with large add and subtract butons in increments of 1, 10, and 100, made it easy to track even very large orders. 

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
i used an additive programing technique to keep things smooth and building as i went (with my first iteration) going forward i think i will use an online repository form stage one so i don't loose my work like i did throughout this course.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
i teseted my code manualy throught this course to keep things smooth. Each time i would finish a block i would build and run to test that build. It was an aditive development menthod, again with a major componnent missing. BACKUPS.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
trying to pick up the pieces from my lost data was a major issue that i still have not recovered form. As far as the programing itself, finding a way to not allow inventory to go negetive was a mjor issue i ran into. i had it at one point throwing a warning but allowing it. the warning read "OUT OF STOCK BY X AMMOUNT! ORDER MORE" The X would be replaced by the negetive number inverted to positive. I was very happy with this error message handling and am quite upset i wont be able to share it with you since my app is now no longer functioning.

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
AS listed above i was quite happy with my error handling for negetive stock numbers. Beeing in IT for the last six years has taught me that my bigest pet peeve is inproper or unhelpful error handling.
